# Codebook for the tidy data set (tidydata.txt) output by run_analysis.txt

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

Each row of the data set contains the mean value recorded for each measurement, over the duration of a given activity for a given subject.
